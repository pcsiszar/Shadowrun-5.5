## Downtime

When Shadowrunning, you never know when you are needed. But when you are not risking your life for some nuyen, you get
to decide how you spend your time, and money.

The passage of time in Shadowrun 5.5 is done incrementally, where the players declare what they want to do,
then thethe GM resolves those actions, then moves on to the next time period. It is entirely up to the GM to decide when
the players get a mission, a day off, or some major drek.

One day consists of 3 phases, morning, afternoon and night. Each is roughly equivalent and they are the smallest units
of time that a character can spend doing something.

The players have the following options:

- Rest and Heal (You roll recovery for both your Stun and Physical Condition Monitor)
- Socialize with a Contact (You roleplay an interaction with one of your contacts to increase their
  Loyalty [1 per day per Contact & 2 per week per contact])
- Assist a Contact (You do a favour for a Contact that hepls them do their business. Increase their Loyalty and their
  Connection Rating by 1 for 2000 nuyen x New Rating or Karma x New Rating [1 per week per Contact])
- Ask a Contact for help (see Contacts)
- Stand up for the People (You conduct yourself in a selfless, charitable manner, earning you 1 karma per 2000 nuyen
  spent)
- Work a Side Biz (You find a small one-time gig that pays as well as you can leave your conscience at the door, earning
  you 50 nuyen + 2000 nuyen per Karma)
- Go shopping (Buy yourself anything that has Availability equal to or lower than your Street Cred x 2 + A Relevant
  Contact's Connection Rating, or designate an Item you wish to buy, and lower it's Availability by 1 temporarily until
  you purchase that item)
- Improve yourself (Declare 1 skill or attribute you wish to improve. Increase it by 1 for it's regular cost, or you
  earn 1 Virtual Karma that can only be spent on the designated Skill Increase, Specialization, Martial Art, Spell, Foci
  Bonding,
  Initiation, Submerging, or Attribute Increase.
  This Virtual Karma can be combined with regular Karma to pay for the improvement.)
- Do anything else you feel like doing.
