### Actions [Page 49]

Actions have been rebranded as Major, Minor and Free Actions.

### Attributes [Page 51]

Strength has absorbed Body as an attribute.
This applies to each and every aspect that was governed by these attributes,
including:

- Condition Monitors
- Skills
- Damage Resist
- etc.

When considering attribute maximums, and starting scores, always calculate with Strength.
When something would increase your Strenght or Body, you can apply it to your Strength.
If something were to increase both attributes, use the Strength value.

In Chummer, after moving to Career mode, apply to new Body Value as a special modification.

### Edge Use [Page 56]

The additional dice you roll from Blitz also count in the action economy.

### Priority Table [Page 65]

Metatypes that have 0 special attribute points in the table increase their available
special attributes to 1.

Aspected Magicians at Priority C also get 7 spells and increase their Magic to 4 instead of 3.
Aspected Magicians at Priority B get 10 spells.

Resources at Priority A are increased by an additional 5000 nuyen to 455,000 nuyen.

Skill tables have been massively changed to favour Skill Groups more heavily.

(Supported by Custom Chummer Zip)

### Aspected Magicians [Page 69]

Aspected magicians choose a spell category instead:

- Combat
- Detection
- Health
- Manipulation
- Illusion

They may only learn spells of the given type and they can only summon spirits that match that spell's type in
their tradition. They may learn Sorcery, Enchanting and Conjuring skills as a regular mage would.

### Positive Qualities [Page 71]

Aptitude's Karma cost is decreased to 7 from 14

### Negative Qualities [Page 84]

National SIN is now 10 Karma up from 5. National SINs grant you the advantage of having a full fledged SIN on with the
downside of any authority with access to the Global SIN Registry having an easier time finding you. Whenever you do
something that causes your Notoriety to increase, the GM can roll an amount of D6 equal to your Notoriety. If they score
5 hits, the system matched managed to narrow down that you have taken part in illegal activities, making you into a
wanted criminal. All your assets linked to your SIN are frozen, and law enforcement is dispatched to the residence
marked on your official SIN. Your Notoriety also increases by 1 when this happens, and your SIN becomes a Criminal SIN.

Criminal SIN is now 20 Karma, up from 10. You start the game with 1 Notoriety. Whenever your Notoriety increases, the
GM might roll an amount of D6 equal to your Notoriety. If they score more than 4 hits, your Notoriety increases by 1.

Corporate Limited SIN and Corporate SIN is now merged together into Coporate Affiliated SIN. This quality costs 0 Karma.
This grants you the benefits of a National SIN except the GM will have to score 6 hits instead of 5. Corporations tend
to protect their own. However, if you caused harm to the Corporation that issued your SIN in any way, and that caused
your Notoriety to go up, the System only has to score 3 hits, at which point your SIN is either flagged as Criminal,
downgraded to National, or burned, depending on the kind of damage you did.

### Final Calculations [Page 101]

Physical Limit is (Strength x2 + Agility + Reaction) / 3

### Character Advancement [Page 103]

The time it takes to improve your Attributes and Skills are overruled by the Offtime System. Attributes take four
Offtime Action to increase beyond their Karma Cost from 0 to 4, eight from 5 to 8 and twelve from 8 to 12. Skills take
two, four, and eight in their respective skill point range.

### Buying Qualities after Chargen [Page 106]

Negative Qualities can be purchased off for just their Karma Value and Positive Qualities can be bought with their Karma
value instead of twice their Karma cost.

### Combat Active Skills [Page 130]

Delnar Skills Remake applied:

This all is Supported by Chummer.

### Combat [Page 158]

This is the big one.

#### Initiative and Action Economy

Initiative is still determined by Reaction + Intuition + Initiatie Dice, but this simply determines the order
in which characters or groups of characters act. You only roll initiative once at the start of combat.

On each turn, players receive one Major Action, one Free Action, and an amount of Minor Actions equal to the character's
initiative dice plus one. So for example:

Magma has Reaction 5, Intuition 3 and 2 initiative dice from a Rating 1 Wired Reflexes. He gets 1 Major, 1 Free, and
3 Minor Actions.

You can exchange 3 Minor Actions for a Major Action.
You can always exchange a Minor or Major action for a Free action, and you can always exchange a Major action for a
Minor action.

Whenever you'd get more initiative dice, you immediately get the Minor Actions from it too.

You can choose to delay your turn. After any character has finished their turn that is after yours in the initiative
order, you can decide to have your delayed turn.

#### Movement

Your base walking speed is REA + AGI per turn. You can spend a Minor Action to run instead of walk, causing your
movement speed to double. Running causes no penalty to your actions, but also no advantage on meele attacks.

If you want to go full speed you can spend a Major action instead to break into a full Sprint.
You get to make an Athletics + STR test and add twice the number of hits scored as additional meters in addition to the
doubled movement speed.

Movement does not cost a free action.

If exact distances are hard to keep track of while you play, you can have all characters move roughly the same distance,
and have running and sprinting double or triple it respectively.

#### Action Mapping

For most of the possible Actions in the Core Rulebook, you can use the mapping of:
Complex Action -> Major Action
Simple Action -> Minor Action

The following are the exceptions:
Running -> Minor Action
Reckless Spellcasting -> Removed
Command Spirit -> Removed
Fire Bow -> Major Action
Fire Weapon -> Major Action
Rigger Jump In -> Minor Action
Astral Projection -> Minor Action
Block -> Minor Action

Interrupt Actions costing -5 now cost a Minor Action, those costing -10 cost a Major action.
Interrupt Actions have to be declared before rolling for the defense test. You cannot see how many hits you could score
without them and then decide to roll the additional ones.

#### Action Changes

Take Aim confers image magnification or scope bonuses, but either has to be used to reset recoil, or add +1 accuracy
and +1 dice. The limit on how many times you can take this action is still half the character's Willpower rounded up,
but the bonuses are lost at the beginning of the characters next turn.

Block and Parry add the net hit scored by the defender, if any, to their next meele attack against the attacking
character. They can also be used against ranged attacks if they are in meele range.

Dodge enables you to move a number of meters equal to your net hits, if any, at it also works against ranged attacks.

Intercept allows you to attack the target trying to leave your meele range without costing an additional action.

#### Elemental Damage

Acid damage reduces Armor all at once by net hits scored on the attack roll. This is immediately applied on the Damage
soak roll.

Cold Damage applies a negative dice modifier to the next Physical Action (Linked to Phys. Attribute) of the target.

Electricity Damage can be Stun instead of Physical at the caster's discretion. A character that has taken electricity
damage will have 1 less minor action on their next turn. This does not accumulate with multiple hits. Electricity
damage will also deal 2 damage per net hit to drones and other electrical devices instead of 1 per net hit.

Fire damage deals 2 damage per net hit to biological targets instead of 1 per net hit.

#### Defense

Characters defend against attacks with only Reaction by default instead of Reaction + Intuition.

#### Damage and Multiple Attack

In Shadowpunk, groups of enemies often act and suffer together as a single unit. Normally, an attack against a unit
would only affect a single member of it, any additional damage that would have been dealt to it after it is eliminated
no longer matters.

This changes when a character uses the Multiple Attack free action, or uses an Area of Effect attack. When this action
is used, your excess damage is dealt to the next member of the unit, then the next if that enemy was also downed.
The limit of how many enemies your damage can overflow to is equal to the number of additional enemies you could target
according to the original rules.
Attacks that can make use of the Multiple Attack action are:

- Shotguns with appropriate choke settingsv (Overflow limit set defined by choke settings)
- Dual Wielded weapons (Doubles the overflow limit of the firing mode)
- Meele Attacks (Overflow limit equal to the amount of targets in meele range)
- Weapons firing multiple bullets (Overflow limit equal to the bullets fired)
- Projectile weapons that have readied multiple projectiles. (Overflow limit equal to the amount of projectiles readied)

#### Ranged Combat

Environmental Modifiers act as a second threshold on the defense test instead of negative modifiers. That means that the
attacker has to score more at least as many hits than the environmental threshold, and more hits than the defender.

Environmental modifiers are changed in the following ways:

| Modifier  | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| 0         | 0         |
| -1        | 1         |
| -3        | 2         |
| -6        | 3         |

Environmental modifiers are cumulative. This means that even on an unaware target who gets no defence test, sniping him
on a dark knight (2) with heavy rain (3) and from an extreme distance (3) with light wind (1) you'd need to score 9
hits to hit.

Environmental Thresholds do not affect net hits scored, that always counts against the defender's hits.

Recoil resets at the beginning of each character's turn.

Suppressive fire is defended against by Reaction only.

Dual wielding allows you to fire the guns you are holding in the same action if they are the same type and have the
same firing mode set. This means double the amount of bullets you shoot, but also double the recoil penalty!

Grenades are now a simple opposed test when attacking. Roll Throwing Weapons + AGI vs Reaction. Environmental Thresholds
also apply, and if they are not met, the grenade scatters harmlessly somewhere else. Cover does not count against
grenades. If the defender is successful they automatically move outside of the attack's range. If the defender is not
successful, the damage gets taken by a single target and automatically overflows. All grenade damage that decreases by
the number of meters away from the blast zone is reduced by 4 to account for the damage getting spread out evenly, but
net hits do cause more damage. Timer based grenades also grant a +4 modifier to the defender.

Sensor Attacks and Sensor Targeting are removed from the game.

#### Called Shots

Shake Up causes the defender to lose a Minor Action.

#### Cover and Barriers

Taking Cover now adds 3 auto hits to your Defense test no matter the cover you are in. This is under the assumption that
no matter the size of the cover, you manage to hide your full body behind it and only periodically peek outside. You can
always ask if there is any suitable cover around, or if a specific object could function as cover.

If the attacker has more hits than the hits you got from rolling dice, they hit the cover you are standing behind.
From then on, apply the standard rules for when a projectile hits a barrier, except the GM may grant the Barrier
additional armor depending on how thick it is.

Any effect from your gun that would decrease the dice rolled for defense test such as shotgun spreads or full auto does
not reduce the auto hits from the cover.

The dodge interrupt action and the cover auto hits are exclusive.

A character is no longer in cover once he has moved, taken aim, performed an attack, cast a spell or summoned a sprit.

#### Meele Combat

Attacking an opponent in meele range with a ranged weapon has a -2 penalty with a pistol, -4 with an SMG, -6 with
anything larger.

#### Unit Combat

Opposition in Shadowrun is usually not a single opponent, but a group of enemies, be it guards, paracritters, or drones.
In order to simplify combat against a mass number of enemies, this system uses the Unit Combat rules.

When Unit Combat is in effect, the enemies are grouped together into units. They retain their original statistics except
for their Condition Monitor, which is modified to be a fraction of the original CM (Expect roughly to match Professional
Rating, but don't take that as guaranteed).

Instead of rolling initiative for all members of the unit individually, roll once to determine their position in the
initiative order. When they take an action, all members of that unit take that same action, and use the same roll to
resolve that action, but they do not have to perform that action the same way as the other members.

This is most prevalent when moving, taking cover, or attacking. Members don't have to move to the same position when
moving, don't have to move into the same cover, or shoot the same target.

If a member of the unit is unable to perform that specific action, for example, if the rest of his squad fires with
Long Arms skill, but he doesn't have a weapon that uses that skill, the action is lost.

If a unit rolls for an action and members would have different modifiers based on their status effects and their
position, the majority rule applies. For example, if two members are shooting from Medium Range, but one is from Short
range, the roll uses the Medium Range environmental threshold. If there is no clear majority, the GM makes the final
call.

Units have to stay in unit coherency. This means that they cannot move to position themselves in a way where any member
would not have another member of the unit within 10 meters. If unit coherency is broken for any reason, the unit must
move to reestablish coherency, within reasonable limits.

Units cannot attack an opponent in meele range, because of how they might hit their allies. Conversely, other units will
also not shoot at the enemy attacking a friendly unit.

When a Unit declares an attack, all members must declare which enemy they are targeting. If multiple members are
targeting the same opponent, then find the targeted opponent who has the lowest amount of members targeting them.
Add +1 dice to the attack roll for each member targeting that opponent, beyond the first.

To provide an example, a HTR team counting 7 members is up against two Shadowrunners. 4 are targeting runner A and
3 are targeting runner B. All of them have the same weapons and statistics, resulting in a roll of 14, and they get
to add + 2 dice to that dice pool, because there is at least 3 members targeting each enemy they are shooting at.
They could have decided to target the same runner, all seven of them, which would have resulted in 14 + 6 dice.

Each player defends individually against Unit Attacks. Players who failed their defense test take the full damage of
the attack, plus net hits scored against their defense test, against soaking that individually.

When targeting a unit, the attacker must target individual members of the unit. If they are using the Multiple Attack
option, they have to designate the targets before making the attack roll. The environmental thresholds, modifiers, and
defense bonuses are calculated using majority rule.

For example, if a player fires a full auto (10 bullets) on 3 opponents, and spreading the bullets with a 3/3/4 spread,
and two of them are in cover. The unit gets to defend with the three net hits from the cover bonus + Reaction, -2 dice
penalty for the additional bullets that are coming their way.

If there is no majority, the GM makes the final call.

Some attacks against units can cause overflow. When a member of the unit goes down and the remaining damage would over
flow, the rest of the unit does not get to make an additional Damage Resistance Test, they take the full remaining
damage as long as there are eligible targets left.

#### Vehicle Combat

Control Vehicle is removed from the game. As long as the driver is behind the wheels, he controls the vehicle.

Vehicle defense is also Reaction only.

Vehicles can use the dodge interrupt action , but with the appropriate Pilot skill instead.

Full Defense is also applicable to Vehicles.

### Matrix

The second big one.

The Matrix no longer has separate Grids. It does have different Grid subscriptions, but those only matter
as far as connection quality and optional content (ads) are concerned. So using the public grid you recieve a -2
penalty, but will be able to detect everything important around you on the Matrix.

While not in a host, the Matrix version and the physical version roughly correlate to each other.
This is achieved with the Matrix Projection technology.
They help citizens of the Matrix better orientate themselves, since the locations in the Matrix are
mapped to real physical locations in the world. The Grid owners are tasked to try and represent a somewhat accurate VR
version of the real world, mainly concerning permanent infrastructure and geography.
This means roads, buildings and mountains are what you should except to be roughly outlined.

#### Overwatch Score

The Overwatch Score has a maximum of 12 on the Grid, and 8 in the host.

A character's overwatch score is tied to the device and does not reset after rebooting the device.
Instead, the overwatch score goes down by one after an hour being offline. (Going offline erases all your marks.)

The Overwatch Score increases by 2 if you fail an Illegal Matrix action, increases by 1 if you score less net hits than
the total hits scored by the defender you are performing illegal actions against, and 0 otherwise.

The OS does not increase as time passes.

#### Matrix Actions

Matrix Actions that have used Intuition as a linked attribute now use Logic.

Matrix Actions that have used Willpower in the opposing dice pool now use Intuition.

This makes all Matrix tests into Logic + Appropriate Skill vs Intuition + Firewall
Damage is soaked via Device Rating + Firewall for devices and Willpower + Firewall for Biofeedback.

Placing a mark on an icon and then doing something no longer requires separate actions. Declare the
thing you want to do after placing the mark. If after placing the mark, you have sufficient level of access to
do it, then you can perform that after successfully placing the mark, without an additional roll.

#### Noise

Noise is applied as a secondary Threshold much like Enviromental Thresholds.

| Threshold | Distance           | Static Zone                                    | Spam Zone          |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 0         | less than 100m     | Average Conditions                             | Average Conditions |
| 1         | 100 - 1000m        | Abandoned Building                             | City Downtown      |
| 2         | 1 - 10 km          | Rural Area, Abandoned Area, Heavy Rain or Snow | Sprawl Downtown    |
| 3         | 10 - 100km         | Wilderness, Severe Storm                       | Major City Event   |
| 4         | greater than 100km | Caverns, Deserts                               | Major Sprawl Event |

Noise Thresholds are cumulative, so hacking a train in the desert from 100 km away, you will need 8 hits to succeed.
Again, as with Environmental Thresholds, net hits are counted against the defense roll, and you only need to meet the
threshold, not succeed it.

Noise Increasing actions add +1 to the threshold for each Noise Rating they would increas, but they can choose to
decrease the number of hits scored.

When the Highest Matrix attribute of a device is lower than the Noise Threshold, the can no longer work wirelessly.
If the device has no Matrix Attribute, use the Device Rating.

#### Matrix Initiative

When you gain initiative dice due to switching to VR, you immediately gain the Minor Actions granted by the VR extra
dice. You also get to roll with them and add it to your initiative. From then on, your Minor, Major, and Free Actions
can only be spent on Matrix Actions, doing things in the Matrix.

When switching back to AR, you only lose Minor Actions granted to you by going into VR. You can use a VR Minor Action to
switch back to AR, meaning going into VR, doing some hacking, then switching back on the same turn is possible and only
costs 1 regular Minor Action.

#### Units vs the Matrix

When performing a matrix action against a unit, the action affects the whole unit. For example, if an entire unit is
using smartguns, a hacker can eject all of them with one action.

#### Running Silent

You cannot Run Silent in a host. The Running Silent mechanic changes to Spoofing. Unlike when running silent, your
persona is visible to others in the host. You roll Sleaze + Logic to maintain a credible persona and identity while
within the host to fool both the users and the system. This can then lead to Sneaking, Deception, Con, and other tests,
for which...

#### Hacking on the Fly vs Brute Force

Brute Force applies an additional mark compared to Hack on The Fly.
Succeeding or Failing on a Brute Force test in a host activates IC and makes the system identify you as a hacker.
Succeeding or Failing on a Brute Force test on the grid automatically notifies the owner of the target that you tried to
hack them.

Failing a Hack on the Fly does not raise suspicion unless your target's net hits are greater than your overall hits.
If they are, your target is notified of the hacking attempt, but you are not identified as the hacker.

#### Agents

The Agent program is completely reworked. Instead of it providing an virtual servant, the Agent program allows you to
carry along a teammate with you, and use their skills in the Matrix to aid you.

To use the Agent program, have a teammate link up with you with VR. That teammate then sees and hears everything you do,
but cannot receive any damage from any source of damage either the deck or you take, except for when you are both dumped
from the Matrix, in that case the agent character takes the Dumpshock damage.

The benefit of the agent program is that they can be called upon to lend their skills to a situation.
For example, when a decker has to infiltrate the host, they can call upon the Stagecraft or Influence skills of a face
to impersonate a SysAdmin, or a standard user. For cracking files, an infiltrators lockpicking skills can be translated
by the Matrix via special interface to aid the decker in cracking a file. Or a street samurai's gunman skills can help
Data Spike that nasty IC.

Agents cannot assist you when you are placing your mark on something. For all other things, ask the GM.

The actual assistance manifests in a Teamwork test, where the limit is the Agent's Rating. It is important to note that
either the hacker or the Agent can be the leader on the Teamwork test.

While participating as an agent, the personas of the agent is hidden inside the decker's persona, and is carried with
him. This arrangement lasts until either the decker or the agent "ejects", causing the two personas to separate. This is
rather awkward if it happens while infiltrating a host, so try not to get in an argument during the job.

Unlike other programs, you can have multiple Agents running at the same time.

#### Complex Forms

Cleaner reduces your Overwatch Score by half your hits rounded down.

#### Sprites

Sprites no longer have their own initiative and instead act on the same turn as their summoner.

When a sprite is summoned, instead of it receiving the actions from it's dice pool, the summoner gets extra
4 extra Minor Actions. The total Minor Actions a character can use in their turn is
six, no matter what.

The Minor actions gained this way can only be used to control the Sprite, however, other Actions you have can also be
used to Control the sprite, as well as do anything else a character pleases.

Sprites are capable of doing the same thing as Agents, except in reverse. Instead of providing the non-Matrix skills
during the merged period, the Sprite can be asked to handle the Matrix related tests, for the cost of one task.
When spoofing in a host, either the technomancer or the sprite can take care of the veil of cyber deception, but asking
the sprite will cost an additional task.

#### Matrix Simplified

If you want to further simplify the Matrix, you can use these set of rules in addition to the changed ones.

Anything legal done in the Matrix is done vie the Matrix skill, with a Simple Test.

If anybody wants to put the hurt on somebody, resolve it via Data Spike rules.

Marks still limit access rights

For placing marks, Cyberwarfare + Logic vs Intuition + Firewall.

For anything else, Software + Logic vs Intuition + Firewall.

### Rigging

#### Rigging and Drone Armies

A Rigger's drones automatically form a coherent unit and have the Unit Combat rules from the previous section applied
to them. Such a Rigger Unit does not use their own actions and turn, but instead act on the same turn as the Rigger, and
use the Rigger's actions.

The Rigger receives an 3 Minor Actions when he has a drone active and linked to his RCC. These Minor Actions cannot be
used for anything else, but controlling the drones. A Character can still use their regular actions to control the
drones. A character still cannot take more than 6 Minor Actions a turn.

### Magic

#### Perceiving Magic

Perceiving Magic rules apply to sustained spells as well.

Illusion Spells are totall exempt from the Perceiving Magic rules. They have to be resisted with
Logic + Intuition to notice.

#### Spells

Control Thoughts and Control Actions work by granting you Minor Actions equal to your net hits on the test.
You immediately gain those actions, but you cannot spend more than 6 Minor Actions in a turn.
If those Minor Actions are used, the spell ends.

##### A Note on Suicide

This is a valid tactic as far as regular grunts go, but high value targets usually carry some sort of Grey Mana or other
defensive measures in order to ward off assassins who would use these tactics. Also, bodyguards can perceive the magic
from the spell around the target (see Perceiving Magic) and move in to stop the target. Also, a subject of Control
Thoughts knows that he was subject to mind control after the spell ends. A subject of the spell Influence does not.

#### Drain

Increase [Attribute] spells cannot increase a character's Drain Resist.

You cannot increase your Drain Resist by using 

#### Counterspelling

Counterspell is now an Interrupt Action that costs a Minor Action and adds your Counterspell skill rating to the defense
test of any spell you perceive.

Dispelling only damages the counterspeller by half the spell's Drain, rounded up.

#### Spirits

Like with Sprites and Drones, you get bonus Minor Actions, which
you can only use to Control the Spirit. You cannot spend more than 6 Minor Actions in a turn.

Spirits add 3 Minor Actions to the summoner's Minor Action pool.

#### Astral Projection

The base initiative dice for Astral Projection is increased to 4D6. (5 Minor Actions)

You can command spirits while Astrally Projecting.

You cannot summon spirits while Astrally Projecting while being more than 100m away from your body.
(This is to counter "Spirit Bomb" tactics.)

The Damage of your Astral Combat attack is your tradition's linked attribute, not just Charisma.

#### Metamagics

Quickening is changed so that it adds +1d6 to your Astral Initiative.

You do not need to have the Masking metamagic to hide your Magical nature, but you get Bonus dice for
Masking Focuses and Initiate Grades. Without those your pool is just your Magic rating.

### Drugs and Addiction

Each time you take an addictive substance, you will immediately make an addiction test (Pg 414 SR5 CRB).

For psychologically addicting drugs, the test will
be [Logic +Willpower +(11 - Drug's Effective Addiction Rating) +(other modifiers)].

For physiologically addicting drugs, the test will
be [Body + Willpower + (11 - Drug's Effective Addiction Rating) + (other modifiers)].

For drugs that are "
Both", the test will be the worse of your two dicepools for the above. Only permanent attribute augmentations apply to
the dicepools for this test. If you fail the test, you immediately suffer the effects of a failed addiction test.

On a failed roll, the Addiction worsens by one level (Mild to Moderate, Moderate to Severe, Severe to Burnout), or the
character gains the Addiction quality at the Mild level if not yet addicted. Afterwards, the character doesn’t have to
make any more Addiction tests when taking additional doses of the same drug in that session.

A character cannot increase their dice pool on the Drug Resistance test by using drugs to increase their physical or
mental attributes.
